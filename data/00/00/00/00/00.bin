  |   From beautiful cityscapes and ocean roads to exploding enemy          |
  |   spaceships, Neon Drive has it all. It's inspired by the arcade        |
  |   games of the 80's, but set against a futuristic backdrop of glowing   |
  |   cyber-grid, all in silky-smooth graphics. Neon Drive brings you 8     |
  |   amazing levels, adding up to hours of enjoyment. Each level           |
  |   features multiple twists and perspective changes, keeping you on      |
  |   your toes (err, wheels) throughout the gameplay.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Neon Drive will put your mad dodging skills to a real test,           |
  |   mercilessly pushing the limits of your reaction time and short-term   |
  |   memory to avoid obstacles and dead-ends. Seriously, this game is      |
  |   wicked; just when you think you've got the hang of it, it turns the   |
  |   table on you.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Each level of the game comes with a custom-made retro music track,    |
  |   perfectly tuned and in sync with the roadblocks and your enemies.     |
  |   This allows you to just follow the beat, unplug, and zen out. Watch   |
  |   the landscape seamlessly morph from one scene to the next, in a       |
  |   ballet of colors and shapes, and let your inner driver take the       |
  |   wheel. You've got this.                                               |
